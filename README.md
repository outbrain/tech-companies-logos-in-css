# Tech Companies Logos in CSS
A repository with tech companies logos made with pure CSS. Why? Beacuse **CSS is awesome!**.

# How to Contribute?

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/outbrain/tech-companies-logos-in-css) repo.
2. Navigate to the "**logos**" folder, and create a new folder with your company name. The folder's name should be lowercased and without spaces (use dashed instead. For example: "outbrain", or "apps-flyer").
3. Create both `index.html` and `style.css` files, and add a `logo.png` image file with the original logo. You'll work only with these files (if you use sass / scss, use only one file and commit it as well). No need to commit anything else.
4. Edit the `README.md`, and add your company to the **participating companies** list.
5. Once your code is ready, commited, and pushed, create a pull request.

# Guidelines

Please follow the guidlines below:

- Feel free to use any CSS property you know. As long as it's in CSS, it's valid.
- **Don't use JavaScript / Images / Base64 / SVG**.
- Write readable code. That being said, try to use as less code as you can.
- No need for backward compatability.
